- BitLocker was introduced in Windows Vista and is used to encrypt an entire volume (not just individual files and folders). BitLocker is designed to protect all data on a volume, 
   even if the hard drive is moved to another computer.

- Multi-factor authentication requires that a user demonstrate two of the following:
    - Something you are
    - Something you know
    - Something you have
The only answer that satisfies this requirement is a fingerprint (something you are) and a one-time code text message
  (something you have, as the user must have their cell phone to receive the text message).

- A privacy filter narrows a laptop display's viewing angle so that only the person directly in front can see the display.

- The passwords il0ve2EatIceCr3am! and I love the Linux P3ngu!n Tux both meet the above criteria.

- Transparent data encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database and all backups. TDE encrypts data at rest, which is data that is not currently being used.

- The Guest user account has no password and provides too much access to the system. Unless its use is absolutely required, the Guest user account should remain disabled.

- You could increase this system's overall security by disabling Autorun and setting a screen saver password.

- In this scenario, your user account should be added to the Network Configuration Operator user group. Members of this group can manage a system's IP configuration, 
  which would allow you to troubleshoot network communication issues.

- The technician violated the principle of least privilege, which is the practice of limiting user access rights to be the bare minimum that a user needs to perform their work.

- Because the user account was accessed after work hours, the best solution would have been to restrict the user's login times to work hours only. If this policy were in place, the account could not have been used after hours

- The chain of custody is a document related to evidence gathering that contains details about personnel in possession and control of evidence from the time of discovery up to the time of presentation in court.

- You have already identified the issue, so the next step is to take actions to stop the attack by securing the system. Although it is important to preserve as much information as possible to assist in later investigations, 
  it is critical to stop the attack, even if doing so alerts the attacker or results in the loss of evidence regarding the attack.

- The first step in responding to an incident should be to take actions to stop the attack and contain the damage. If the attack involves a computer system attached to the network, the first step would mostly likely be to
  disconnect the computer from the network. Although you want to preserve as much information as possible to assist in later investigations, it is better to stop the attack, even if doing so alerts the attacker or results
  in the loss of evidence regarding the attack.

- When gathering evidence, it is important to make backup copies of all log files and audit trails. These files will help reconstruct the events leading up to the security violation. They often include important clues
  as to the identity of the attacker or intruder.

- Shutting down or rebooting a compromised system will erase the memory contents. An attacker may load and run a memory-resident program and immediately erase it from the disk. Shutting down or rebooting the system
  will destroy all evidence of the malicious program.

- Preserving evidence while conducting a forensic investigation is a trade-off. Any attempt to collect evidence may actually destroy the very data needed to identify an attack or attacker. Of the choices given, 
  documenting what is on the screen is the least intrusive and the least likely to destroy critical evidence.

- The different incident detection methods are described below.

- Proactive
    - An organization looks for existing security flaws in their system.

  Active
    - A network intrusion detection system (IDS) detects malicious traffic.

  Passive
    - A technician performing maintenance on a computer discovers prohibited content.
    - A device or practice helps determine how and why a security incident occurred.  

- In this situation, your school would be in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA defines who student records can be shared with, and the office assistant 
  would be in violation for sharing these records with an unauthorized individual.

- In this scenario, you would most likely need to make sure that the company is in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA). HIPAA defines and regulates
  how healthcare information must be secured.

- Personal government-issued information is anything that is assigned by the government, such as a driver's license and a social security number.
<h2>14.3 Physical Security</h2>

- Your main concern, in this case, is with the laptops being stolen. The best protection against physical theft is to secure the laptops in place using cable locks.

- Cable locks can be used to physically secure laptops in order to deter theft.

- You should recommend the following:

    - Disable the network jacks in the reception area. Having these jacks in an unsecured area allows anyone who comes into the building to connect to the company's network.

    - Train the receptionist to keep their iPad in a locked drawer when not in use. Tablet devices are small and easily stolen if left unattended. 

- Bollards should be installed to prevent vehicles from driving straight to the building entrance. Bollards are metal poles that are secured into the ground to prevent vehicle access.
  Bollards should be placed near the front of any building to prevent vehicles from getting too close.

- A key fob provides a keyless authentication to a specific lock. The key fob may use a wireless radio signal, NFC, or Bluetooth to communicate with the lock.

- A magnetometer is a metal detector that users walk through to detect whether they are bringing any weapons or unauthorized equipment into the building. This should be installed
  just inside the entrance to the building.

- Motion sensors can be implemented to trigger spotlights or alarms when motion is detected. The motion sensors can be used both inside and outside of a building.

- You could implement an access control vestibule (ACV) at each entrance to the facility. An ACV is a specialized entrance with two doors that creates a security buffer
  zone between two areas.

- Security guards can provide a high level of security inside and outside the property. They should be stationed at the entrance(s). The guards should have an access list
  that states who is allowed onto the property.

- In this scenario, the WAP should be installed on the ceiling or in a special locked box to prevent unauthorized access.
<h2>14.4 Logical Security Measures</h2>

<h3>14.4.2 Logical Security Measures Facts</h3>
<h3>14.4.3 Configure a Screen Saver Password</h3>
<h3>14.4.4 Screen Saver Lab</h3>
<h3>14.4.5 Elevate Privileges on Linux</h3>
su = switch user -- 'root' default
<h3>14.4.6 Configure Password Policies on Windows</h3>
Local Security Policy
- set number of login attempts
- require strong password (length and symbols)
<h3>14.4.7 Enforce Password Strength Windows Lab</h3>

<h3>14.4.9 Manage Authentication on Windows</h3>
<h3>14.4.10 Use Window Certificate Manager</h3>
<h3>14.4.11 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Access control lists (ACLs) are used to manage and enforce what a user is authorized to access.

- Authorization defines which resources a user is able to access once he or she is authenticated.

- Authentication is the process by which users provide credentials to prove their identity.

- Hard tokens provide a higher level of security, but if the token is lost or stolen, the 
  security breach can be quite severe. Implementing hard tokens can also be expensive and
  time-consuming. They are generally reserved for highly sensitive data.

- The principle of least privilege states that a user should be given access to only the 
  resources needed to perform their job. In this scenario, users have access to more than what
  they need. The company should implement the principle of least privilege to secure their networks.

- This is an example of mobile device management (MDM). MDM software is used by administrators to
  secure mobile devices and to enforce enterprise policies on the devices. MDM software is often
  used alongside a bring your own device(BYOD) policy and is typically deployed as a combination
  of an on-device application or agent that communicates with a backend server. The application
  receives policies and settings from the server to configure and control the mobile device.

- Multi-factor authentication means that at least two categories of authentication methods
  are utilized. Of these options, having the user input a PIN (something you know) and use an
  authentication app (something you have) is the only example of multi-factor authentication.

- A soft token is any digital authentication key that is used to authenticate a user. 
  Of these options, only the authentication app is a soft token, since an authentication
  app is a digital app on a phone or tablet.

- Biometrics (fingerprint scanner) fall under the something you are authentication category.

- A username and password falls under the something you know authentication category.

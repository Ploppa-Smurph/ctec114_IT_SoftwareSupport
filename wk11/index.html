- BitLocker was introduced in Windows Vista and is used to encrypt an entire volume (not just individual files and folders). BitLocker is designed to protect all data on a volume, 
   even if the hard drive is moved to another computer.

- Multi-factor authentication requires that a user demonstrate two of the following:
    - Something you are
    - Something you know
    - Something you have
The only answer that satisfies this requirement is a fingerprint (something you are) and a one-time code text message
  (something you have, as the user must have their cell phone to receive the text message).

- A privacy filter narrows a laptop display's viewing angle so that only the person directly in front can see the display.

- The passwords il0ve2EatIceCr3am! and I love the Linux P3ngu!n Tux both meet the above criteria.

- Transparent data encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database and all backups. TDE encrypts data at rest, which is data that is not currently being used.

- The Guest user account has no password and provides too much access to the system. Unless its use is absolutely required, the Guest user account should remain disabled.

- You could increase this system's overall security by disabling Autorun and setting a screen saver password.

- In this scenario, your user account should be added to the Network Configuration Operator user group. Members of this group can manage a system's IP configuration, 
  which would allow you to troubleshoot network communication issues.

- The technician violated the principle of least privilege, which is the practice of limiting user access rights to be the bare minimum that a user needs to perform their work.

- Because the user account was accessed after work hours, the best solution would have been to restrict the user's login times to work hours only. If this policy were in place, the account could not have been used after hours
<h2>14.2 Incident Response and Regulated Data</h2>
<h3>14.2.1 Incident Response</h3>

<h3>14.2.5 Quiz Facts</h3>
- The chain of custody is a document related to evidence gathering that contains details about personnel in possession and control of evidence from the time of discovery up to the time of presentation in court.

- You have already identified the issue, so the next step is to take actions to stop the attack by securing the system. Although it is important to preserve as much information as possible to assist in later investigations, 
  it is critical to stop the attack, even if doing so alerts the attacker or results in the loss of evidence regarding the attack.

- The first step in responding to an incident should be to take actions to stop the attack and contain the damage. If the attack involves a computer system attached to the network, the first step would mostly likely be to
  disconnect the computer from the network. Although you want to preserve as much information as possible to assist in later investigations, it is better to stop the attack, even if doing so alerts the attacker or results
  in the loss of evidence regarding the attack.

- When gathering evidence, it is important to make backup copies of all log files and audit trails. These files will help reconstruct the events leading up to the security violation. They often include important clues
  as to the identity of the attacker or intruder.

- Shutting down or rebooting a compromised system will erase the memory contents. An attacker may load and run a memory-resident program and immediately erase it from the disk. Shutting down or rebooting the system
  will destroy all evidence of the malicious program.

- Preserving evidence while conducting a forensic investigation is a trade-off. Any attempt to collect evidence may actually destroy the very data needed to identify an attack or attacker. Of the choices given, 
  documenting what is on the screen is the least intrusive and the least likely to destroy critical evidence.

- The different incident detection methods are described below.

- Proactive
    - An organization looks for existing security flaws in their system.

  Active
    - A network intrusion detection system (IDS) detects malicious traffic.

  Passive
    - A technician performing maintenance on a computer discovers prohibited content.
    - A device or practice helps determine how and why a security incident occurred.  

- In this situation, your school would be in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA defines who student records can be shared with, and the office assistant 
  would be in violation for sharing these records with an unauthorized individual.

- In this scenario, you would most likely need to make sure that the company is in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA). HIPAA defines and regulates
  how healthcare information must be secured.

- Personal government-issued information is anything that is assigned by the government, such as a driver's license and a social security number.
<h2>14.3 Physical Security</h2>

<h3>14.3.4 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Your main concern, in this case, is with the laptops being stolen. The best protection against physical theft is to secure the laptops in place using cable locks.

- Cable locks can be used to physically secure laptops in order to deter theft.

- You should recommend the following:

    - Disable the network jacks in the reception area. Having these jacks in an unsecured area allows anyone who comes into the building to connect to the company's network.

    - Train the receptionist to keep their iPad in a locked drawer when not in use. Tablet devices are small and easily stolen if left unattended. 

- Bollards should be installed to prevent vehicles from driving straight to the building entrance. Bollards are metal poles that are secured into the ground to prevent vehicle access.
  Bollards should be placed near the front of any building to prevent vehicles from getting too close.

- A key fob provides a keyless authentication to a specific lock. The key fob may use a wireless radio signal, NFC, or Bluetooth to communicate with the lock.

- A magnetometer is a metal detector that users walk through to detect whether they are bringing any weapons or unauthorized equipment into the building. This should be installed
  just inside the entrance to the building.

- Motion sensors can be implemented to trigger spotlights or alarms when motion is detected. The motion sensors can be used both inside and outside of a building.

- You could implement an access control vestibule (ACV) at each entrance to the facility. An ACV is a specialized entrance with two doors that creates a security buffer
  zone between two areas.

- Security guards can provide a high level of security inside and outside the property. They should be stationed at the entrance(s). The guards should have an access list
  that states who is allowed onto the property.

- In this scenario, the WAP should be installed on the ceiling or in a special locked box to prevent unauthorized access.

<h3>14.4.11 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Access control lists (ACLs) are used to manage and enforce what a user is authorized to access.

- Authorization defines which resources a user is able to access once he or she is authenticated.

- Authentication is the process by which users provide credentials to prove their identity.

- Hard tokens provide a higher level of security, but if the token is lost or stolen, the 
  security breach can be quite severe. Implementing hard tokens can also be expensive and
  time-consuming. They are generally reserved for highly sensitive data.

- The principle of least privilege states that a user should be given access to only the 
  resources needed to perform their job. In this scenario, users have access to more than what
  they need. The company should implement the principle of least privilege to secure their networks.

- This is an example of mobile device management (MDM). MDM software is used by administrators to
  secure mobile devices and to enforce enterprise policies on the devices. MDM software is often
  used alongside a bring your own device(BYOD) policy and is typically deployed as a combination
  of an on-device application or agent that communicates with a backend server. The application
  receives policies and settings from the server to configure and control the mobile device.

- Multi-factor authentication means that at least two categories of authentication methods
  are utilized. Of these options, having the user input a PIN (something you know) and use an
  authentication app (something you have) is the only example of multi-factor authentication.

- A soft token is any digital authentication key that is used to authenticate a user. 
  Of these options, only the authentication app is a soft token, since an authentication
  app is a digital app on a phone or tablet.

- Biometrics (fingerprint scanner) fall under the something you are authentication category.

- A username and password falls under the something you know authentication category.
<h2>14.5 Social Engineering Attacks</h2>

<h3>14.5.3 Threats</h3>
<h3>14.5.4 Threat Facts</h3>
<h3>14.5.5 Vulnerabilities</h3>
<h3>14.5.6 Vulnerability Facts</h3>
<h3>14.5.7 Quiz Facts</h3>
- An impersonation attack has occurred. Impersonation involves an attacker convincing
  authorized personnel to grant them access to protected information by pretending to
  be someone who is authorized and/or requires that access. Often, the attacker poses
  as a member of senior management. A sense of urgency is typically fabricated to 
  motivate the user to act quickly.

- Phishing tricks victims into providing confidential information, such as identity information
  or logon credentials, through emails or websites that impersonate an online entity that the
  victim trusts, such as a financial institution or well known e-commerce site. Phishing is a
  specific form of social engineering.

- An evil twin attack involves an attacker setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point, using a jamming
  or disassociation attack to knock users off the legitimate network, and then having users reconnect
  to the rogue access point in order to gain access to sensitive data.

- The goal of an Application layer DoS is to exhaust the target's resources by overloading a specific program or service.
    * A distributed DoS attack uses multiple computers to generate the necessary traffic.
    * A protocol DoS targets different protocols, such as TCP flags, to overload a network device, such as a firewall.
    * An amplification DoS attack consumes the bandwidth between the target server and the internet, effectively cutting off the target.
    
- a evil twin attack (also called Wi-Fi eavesdropping) is the most likely attack being carried out. In an evil twin attack, the hacker
  tricks users into connecting to a malicious wireless network so they can monitor and manipulate the data packets flowing across the network.
  
- Your client is most likely the victim of an SQL injection attack. SQL is the most common database language and is used by most websites. 
  All sorts of sensitive data, such as user credentials, are stored in these databases. If the SQL database is not properly configured, 
  an attacker can input SQL commands into text fields on a website to gain access to the data. The attacker can steal, edit, or even destroy
  the data contained in the database.

- A zero-day attack exploits a vulnerability in software that has not been discovered by the developer. These attacks are referred to as 
  zero-day attacks because that is how many days the developer has known about the vulnerability.

- BYOD risks include:
    - Data leakage
    - Confidential data exposure
    - Improper disposal
    - Variety of devices
    - Mixing of personal and corporate data
    - Bypassing of security policies
    - BYOD benefits include:

  ** Increased productivity
      *Employee satisfaction
      *Work flexibility
      *Lower costs

- The term mobile device management (MDM) generally describes the policies and procedures used by an organization
  to maintain security and permissions on mobile devices. More specifically, MDM software is used by administrators
  to secure mobile devices and to enforce enterprise policies on the devices. MDM software usually offers a suite of
  features, including:
      - Policy management
      - Security management
      - Inventory management
      - Telecom service management
      - Mobile application management      

- A system with no anti-malware or firewall is considered unprotected. 
<h2>14.6 Data Destruction and Disposal</h2>
High-level format-  	Formatting method that removes the pointers to the data on the drive, but not the data on the drive. The high-level format is the standard format that's done through the operating system tools.
Low-level format- 	Formatting method that writes new sectors and tracks to the drive and is typically done by the manufacturer when the drive is first assembled.
Degaussing- 	Hard drive destruction method that purges the entire hard disk all at once by exposing it to an extremely strong magnetic pulse.
Certificate of destruction (COD)- 	Document that details the method and date of a hard drive's destruction along with the chain of custody.

<h3>14.6.5 Quiz Facts</h3>
- The Chain of Custody identifies who had possession of a device and for how long before it was actually destroyed.

- No matter the method used to destroy a hard drive, a Certificate of Destruction (COD) should be obtained and kept with the organization's records. A COD is usually necessary to satisfy internal security reporting
  requirements and may be required for legal reporting.

- Degaussing is a special tool that uses strong magnetic pulses to destroy all the data on the platters and drive motors.

- Drilling only works with mechanical hard drives since this method involves drilling holes through the platters.

- A high-level format is performed using the tools in the operating system. This method removes the pointers to files, but the data remains on the drive itself and can be recovered using special software.

- Incinerating a hard drive can lead to the release of toxic by-products. This is why you should only use a licensed incinerator.

- You should always perform low-level formatting of the hard drive when you dispose of a computer.

- The COD should include the following information:
    - Method of destruction
    - Date of destruction
    - Chain of Custody    

- Purchasing the special equipment to destroy hard drives is often too cost-prohibitive for most organizations. You should contract with companies that specialize in the destruction and recycling of computer 
  equipment and hard drives when possible.

- A low-level format writes new sectors and tracks to the drive and is typically done by the manufacturer when the drive is first assembled. When performing a low-level format, the sectors and tracks are recreated, 
  and all empty space is filled with zeroes.

- Adware monitors actions that denote personal preferences and then sends pop-ups and ads that match those preferences. Adware is:
    - Usually passive.
    - Invasive.
    - Installed on your machine when you visit a website or run an application.
    - Usually more annoying than harmful.

- Email is the most common means of virus distribution. Often, viruses employ self-contained SMTP servers to facilitate self-replication and distribution over the internet. Viruses are able to spread quickly and broadly
  by exploiting the communication infrastructure of internet email.

 - Malicious websites are also frequently used for virus distribution. For this reason, it is important to keep your antivirus software updated so as to block any possible attempts by viruses to infect your systems or 
   to spread to other systems from your system.

- Spyware monitors the actions you take on your machine and sends the information back to the originating source.

- A Trojan, or Trojan horse, is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.

- A Trojan horse is a program that appears to be a legitimate application, utility, game, or screen saver, but performs malicious activities surreptitiously. Trojan horses are commonly internet downloads. To keep your
  systems secure and free from such malicious code, you need to take extreme caution when downloading any type of file from just about any site on the internet. If you don't fully trust the site or service that is 
  offering a file, don't download it.

- In this scenario, you have most likely booted into a WinPE environment. A Windows Pre-Installation environment (WinPE) is a lightweight version of Windows that boots from a USB drive and is typically used to help 
  deploy Windows in an enterprise environment or to troubleshoot Windows issues.

- The first step in the remediation process is to disable Windows System Restore. Many malware programs embed copies of themselves in the System Restore files so that if the computer is rebooted or a System Restore
  is attempted, the malware simply reinfects the machine. By disabling System Restore, the malware copy is removed and should not be able to reinfect the system.

- When you suspect a malware infection, you should investigate and verify that the symptoms are not from other causes before taking further steps.

- If a malware infection is confirmed, you should immediately quarantine the system to prevent the malware from spreading through the network. You should remove the device from the network and disconnect any 
  shared drives or connections.
 
- After your computer has been cleared of a malware infection, perform a full system backup and save it to an external drive.

Hashing- 	A form of security that applies an algorithm to a string of characters. Hashing is used in network communication to authenticate the origin of the message and validate the integrity of data.
Extensions and plug-ins- 	Small applications you can install on a browser.
Trusted and untrusted sources- 	Sites on the internet that are or are not certified by a certificate authority (CA).
Password manager- 	Software you can use to save and create passwords.
Invalid certificates- 	Certificates that aren't be validated by a certificate authority.
Pop-up blockers- 	Software you can add to a browser that blocks incoming pop ups through operating system and browser settings.
Ad blockers- 	Software you can add to the browser to block incoming advertisements on visited websites.
Browser data- 	Information stored in the browser settings. The browser collects the data for the convenience and functionality with other web pages.
Browser cache- 	Stored information from previous web pages, such as logos, pictures, and backgrounds. This generally makes searching the internet faster.
In private browsing- 	A function of a web browser that limits the amount of browser data it can collect during web searches.
Browser data synchronization- 	A function that allows users to use the same browser settings on multiple devices. The user can update edits or changes to the browser in real time on multiple devices.

- Signing in with the browser password gives a hacker control over all passwords that are stored on that browser. This is especially dangerous if the browser password is leaked or is easily guessed.

- Certificate authority (CA) information is stamped on all packets coming from a website to validate where they came from. If any packets are misdirected through an untrusted site, the browser will 
  detect that the certificate is now invalid and will give the user a warning in the form of a dialog box.
 
- Internal DNS servers, such as one on your company network, can be configured with a list of valid sites. This means that you can allow or deny access to certain sites. The CA on the server will 
  operate using the same authority as on a public site and will give the user a certificate warning if they try to visit their version of an untrusted site.
 
- Hashing generates a string of values that jumbles a password into symbols and letters. Hash codes cannot be reversed, which makes them a good deterrent to security threats. The actual password
  is then saved to the account.

- Two-factor authentication is using two authentication credentials to access one account. For example, once you enter your password to access your account, you receive an alert via email, text
  message, or voicemail message with a confirmation code that you need to also enter before accessing the website.

- Adblockers are extensions that you can attach to your browser to block pop-up ads on a web page. However, blocking these ads can also cause certain sites and browsers to no longer work.

- Once you've created a browser account, there is a settings feature that lets you log into a browser from multiple systems with all information including bookmarks, password information 
  and all security settings, synced. This feature would allow you to access the same bookmarks from both your home laptop and your company workstation.

- In order for browsers to quickly retrieve websites, they often save all the site locations visited, which is referred to as a cache. You can clear the cache to help improve the overall 
  performance of your web browser.
 
- Pop-ups are generally small advertisements with links attached to the web page. These web pages contain java script and can be a great security risk to the user. Most browsers have a way
  of blocking this content in their setting menu with a Pop-up blocker feature.

- Private browsing mode lets you visit websites without the browser keeping search history, cookies or password information.

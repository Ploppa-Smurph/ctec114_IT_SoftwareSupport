- BitLocker was introduced in Windows Vista and is used to encrypt an entire volume (not just individual files and folders). BitLocker is designed to protect all data on a volume, 
   even if the hard drive is moved to another computer.

- Multi-factor authentication requires that a user demonstrate two of the following:
    - Something you are
    - Something you know
    - Something you have
The only answer that satisfies this requirement is a fingerprint (something you are) and a one-time code text message
  (something you have, as the user must have their cell phone to receive the text message).

- A privacy filter narrows a laptop display's viewing angle so that only the person directly in front can see the display.

- The passwords il0ve2EatIceCr3am! and I love the Linux P3ngu!n Tux both meet the above criteria.

- Transparent data encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database and all backups. TDE encrypts data at rest, which is data that is not currently being used.

- The Guest user account has no password and provides too much access to the system. Unless its use is absolutely required, the Guest user account should remain disabled.

- You could increase this system's overall security by disabling Autorun and setting a screen saver password.

- In this scenario, your user account should be added to the Network Configuration Operator user group. Members of this group can manage a system's IP configuration, 
  which would allow you to troubleshoot network communication issues.

- The technician violated the principle of least privilege, which is the practice of limiting user access rights to be the bare minimum that a user needs to perform their work.

- Because the user account was accessed after work hours, the best solution would have been to restrict the user's login times to work hours only. If this policy were in place, the account could not have been used after hours

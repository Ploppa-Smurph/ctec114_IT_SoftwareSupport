<h2>9.1 Manage Files on Windows</h2>
File extension association-	 A mechanism that identifies the program used to create a file.
File attribute- 	Metadata that gives certain qualities to a file after the attribute has been assigned.
Command Prompt- 	A command line tool used for executing commands and managing files and folders.
<h3>9.1.1 Windows File and Folder Properties</h3>
FAT32 & NTFS 

<h3>9.1.2 System File Locations</h3>
<h3>9.1.3 File Management Facts</h3>
- The FAT32 file system supports only the following attributes: R, H, S, and A.
- To change file or folder attributes, edit the properties of the file or folder, or use the Attrib command from the command prompt. (You cannot change permissions with the Attrib command.)
- When you copy files from an NTFS partition to a FAT32 partition, attributes not available under FAT32 do not remain with the file.
- Use Folder Options to show protected operating system files, or to show compressed or encrypted files in a different color.

System files = 	%systemroot% or %windir% =	C:\Windows
Fonts = 	no variable = 	C:\Windows\Fonts
Program files = %programfiles% = C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86) on 64-bit systems only
User files (user profiles) =  %userprofile% =	C:\Users\username
Temporary files (per user) =	%temp% or %tmp% = 	C:\Users\ username\AppData\Local\Temp
<h3>9.1.4 Manage Files on Windows</h3>
<h3>9.1.6 Manage Directories from the Command Prompt</h3>
relative vs absolute path
  absolute = $ dir D:\work  -> list the drive and folder area

  dir | more  --> scroll with the space bar 
<h3>9.1.7 Manage Files from the Command Prompt</h3>
<h3>9.1.8 File Management Commands</h3>
copy-	Use the copy command to copy files from one location to another. Common switches you can use with copy are:
    - copy [source] [destination] copies the specified file to the new location.
    - copy [folder] [*.*] [path] [destination] copies all files with specified extensions in a folder to the new location.
  Common switches include:
        /a specifies that the file is an ASCII text file.
        /b specifies that the file is a binary file.
        /n copies files using short filenames.
        /y performs an overwrite operation without prompting you.
        /v verifies files after they are copied.
  Moving (copying) files between partitions can affect the file attributes. Be aware of the following:
        - When copying files from a FAT32 partition to another partition, the file attributes are retained.
        - When copying files from an NTFS partition to a FAT32 partition, attributes such as encryption and permissions that are not available in FAT32 are removed.

xcopy-	Use the xcopy command to copy files and directory trees. Common switches used with xcopy are:
        /a copies files with the archive attribute set and doesn't change the attribute.
        /m copies files with the archive attribute set and turns off the archive attribute.
        /d copies files changed on or after the specified date. If no date is given, it copies only those files whose source time is newer than the destination time.
        /p prompts you before creating each destination file.
        /s copies directories and subdirectories (except empty ones).
        /e copies directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.
        /h copies hidden and system files also.
        /r overwrites read-only files.
        /k copies attributes. Normal xcopy resets read-only attributes.
        /y overwrites existing files without prompting.

robocopy-	Use the robocopy (robust file copy) command to copy entire folder structures between volumes or across a network. The benefit of using robocopy is that all NTFS file permissions and attributes are maintained and interrupted transfers can be resumed. Common switches you can use with robocopy are:
    - robocopy [source_folder] [destination] [options] copies entire folder structures to destination.
  Common switches include:
        /s copies subdirectories, excluding empty directories.
        /e copies subdirectories, including empty directories.
        /mov moves all specified files and directories. It deletes them from the source when complete.
        /copyall copies all files attributes and information.
    * Robocopy is a very powerful copy utility. Use it only if you fully understand how to use it.

attrib- 	Use the attrib command to change or view the attributes of one or more files.
    - Use the attrib command by itself to display a list of all files in the current directory.
    - Attributes that can be set or removed are identified by the attribute letter:
        R—read-only
        A—archive
        S—system
        H—hidden
        I—not indexed
  * You cannot encrypt files using the attrib command. Instead, use the cipher command or edit the properties of the file.
    - Use attrib + to add an attribute to a file. For example, the following command sets the R attribute for the myfile.txt file: attrib +r myfile.txt.
    - Use attrib - to remove an attribute from a file. For example, the following command removes the R attribute from a file: attrib -r myfile.txt.
 You can assign or remove multiple attributes at the same time. For example, the following command assigns both R and S attributes to the file: attrib +r +s myfile.txt. You can also change attributes by right-clicking a file and selecting Properties from the menu.
 <h3>9.1.10 Quiz Facts</h3>
 - On a 64-bit Windows operating system, all 32-bit programs are installed in the Program Files (x86) directory by default.

 - The Archive (A) attribute identifies whether a file has been modified since the last backup.

 - Only the Read-only (R) attribute is retained (not the Encryption, nor NTFS permissions).
    * The FAT32 file system only supports the following attributes: R, H, S, and A. When you copy files from an NTFS partition to a FAT32 partition, attributes unavailable under FAT32 do not remain with the file. Moving NTFS files to a non-NTFS partition removes the permissions.

- On Windows 11, user profiles are stored on the system root drive in the Users\username directories. If C: is the system root drive, user profiles are stored in C:\Users\username.

- When you saved the file using the File > Save as feature, you probably deleted or misspelled the file extension. When Mark tried to open the file, his system didn't know which program it should use to open the file. You can easily fix this problem by renaming the file with the
  correct file extension. As an example, the text file may have been saved as myfile.tzt instead of myfile.txt.

- Use attrib +r -h to add the Read-only attribute and remove the Hidden attribute.  

- The attrib +s +r -a myfile.dll command adds the System file attribute, adds the Read-only attribute, and removes the Archive attribute for myfile.dll.

- Use xcopy /e to copy directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.

- The md (make directory) command creates a directory/folder or subdirectory/subfolder.

- The robocopy (short for robust file copy) command is used to copy entire folder structures between volumes or across a network. The benefit of using robocopy is that interrupted transfers can be resumed. In this scenario, when the janitor plugged the router 
    back into the outlet, robocopy would have resumed the copy process, and the files would have been copied when you returned the next day.
<h2>9.2 NTFS and Share Permissions</h2>
NTFS permissions- 	Permissions used to manage and secure files and folders within an NTFS file system.
Shared folder- 	A set of files that are made available to other users over a network.
Share permissions- 	Permissions used to control the level of access users have when accessing files over the network.
<h3>9.2.1 NTFS and Share Permissions</h3>

<h3>9.2.2 NTFS and Share Permission Facts</h3>
<b>Share Permissions</b>
Full control	Full control actions are:
                    - Ownership
                    - Read
                    - Write
                    - Create
                    - Delete
                    - Change permissions
Change	        Change actions are:
                    - Read
                    - Write
                    - Create
                    - Delete
Read	        Read actions are:
                    - Read
                    - Copy
                    - Run

<b>NTFS Permissions</b> -- differ from share permissions in several ways: 
    - Apply to files accessed over the network or locally.
    - Offer granular control over folders and files.
    - Can be assigned to system users.
<h3>9.2.3 Configure Basic Folder Sharing on Windows</h3>
<h3>9.2.4 Configure Advanced Folder Sharing on Windows</h3>
\\HOSTNAME\Sharefolder
<h3>9.2.5 Configure Share and NTFS Permissions</h3>
<h3>9.2.6 Configure NTFS Permissions</h3>
<h3>9.2.9 Quiz Facts</h3>
- By default, Windows automatically creates an administrative share for every volume.
    -Because administrative shares are not visible when browsing the network, you must use the UNC path to connect to an administrative share. Only members of the Administrators group can access default administrative shares.
    -Adding a $ sign (not a !) to the end of a share name creates an administrative share.

- Users will have Allow Full Control for both files in the C:\PublicReports folder.
    -When you move or copy files to an NTFS partition, the files inherit the permissions configured for the parent folders. If you had configured explicit permissions for the files, the moved file would retain the explicit permissions.
    -Copying files to new folders or partitions removes any existing permissions so that only inherited permissions apply.    

- To prevent Rachel from accessing the singular file, you should assign the user account the Deny Full Control permission for the file. Deny permissions override Allow permissions.

- The C$ administrative share (\\computername\C$) is available to technicians with administrator privileges. This share is the fastest way to transfer a file.

- By creating a network share for Jane's folder that contains her documents, you can grant the managers the ability to see and read these documents. All other employees will not have access if the rights are granted appropriately. If a manager forgets the path, they will still be able to easily find the folder by looking for shared folders on her computer.
    - Administrative shares are created by the operating system, so you cannot set specific share permissions and file security.
    - A hidden share is a form of network share that cannot be viewed by others when they are searching for the shared location. These shares are created by adding a dollar sign ($) to the end of the share when it is created. Although this could work for Jane's files, it would require that Jane give the path to each manager. Since Jane wanted to make this process as simple as possible, using a network share would be easier.
    - A VPN, or virtual private network, allows you to create a secure tunnel between your company network and a remote location over an existing connection, usually the internet. This is not required to share folders with fellow employees on the same local network.
    - A remote desktop connection gives someone the ability to log on to another computer from their computer. This would not be a suitable solution, as it would be difficult to limit rights.

- Use the net use command to list the currently connected shared folders and drive letters.
    - ipconfig displays the TCP/IP configuration for network interfaces.
    - netstat displays protocol connections that have been established by the system as well as which incoming TCP/IP ports are in use.
    - tracert displays information on the route that a packet takes as it traverses the network to a remote host.    

- Permissions will be removed from both files. Moving or copying files to a non-NTFS partition removes all permissions (FAT32 does not support NTFS permissions).
   - Moving files to the same NTFS partition preserves the permissions. Copying files to another partition (NTFS or otherwise) removes existing permissions. Copied files on an NTFS partition inherit the permissions assigned to the drive or folder, and copied files on a non-NTFS partition do not inherit permissions because no permissions exist.

- To control both local and network access, you will need to use both NTFS and share permissions.
    - The folder must be located on an NTFS partition to be able to configure NTFS permissions. Configuring only NTFS permissions will not allow network access. Configuring only shared permissions with the files on a FAT32 partition will not control local access.   

- When you evaluate the interaction between Full Control and NTFS permissions, remember that the most restrictive set of permissions takes precedence. In this case, the NTFS permissions (Read and Write) are more restrictive than the Full Control permission granted to the Everyone group through the share, so the effective permissions are Read and Write.

- The UNC format is \\Servername\Sharename. Use \\Home1\Pictures to access the shared folder.
<h2>9.3 File Encryption</h2>
<h3>9.3.1 File Encryption</h3>
<h3>9.3.2 File Encryption Facts</h3>
<h3>9.3.3 Encrypt Files</h3>
<h3>9.3.5 BitLocker</h3>
<h3>9.3.6 Use BitLocker</h3>
<h3>9.3.7 BitLocker Facts</h3>
BitLocker differs from the EFS in the following ways:
    - BitLocker encrypts the entire volume. EFS encrypts individual files.
    - BitLocker encrypts the volume for use on the computer, regardless of the user. Any user who has the PIN or startup key and who can successfully log on can access a BitLocker volume. With EFS, only the user who encrypted the file can access the file unless access has been granted to other users.
    - BitLocker protects files against offline access only. If the computer boots successfully, any authorized user who can log on can access the volume and its data. EFS protects against offline access as well as online access for unauthorized users. EFS does not provide online protection if an authorized user's credentials are compromised.
<h3>9.3.9 Quiz Facts</h3>
- EFS encryption is only a feature of the NTFS file system, and thumb drives are normally formatted with FAT32. Because EFS does not work on FAT32 or eFAT, copying an encrypted file from your NTFS volume to a thumb drive means that the file will no longer be encrypted.
        - Because the file is copied to a FAT32 file system on the thumb drive, the file will no longer be secure and will be completely accessible to anyone.
        - Encryption cannot be used with compression, which means that the EFS-encrypted file will not be compressed.

- After creating an FEK for the file, EFS then encrypts the FEK through asymmetric encryption by creating a private key and a public key.

- EFS is a Windows file encryption option that encrypts individual files so that only the user who created the file can open it. Decryption is automatic when the file owner opens it. Other users cannot open the encrypted file unless specifically authorized.
     - BitLocker is a Microsoft security solution that encrypts the entire contents of a hard drive, protecting all files on the disk. BitLocker uses a special key, which is required to unlock the hard disk. You cannot unlock/decrypt a drive simply by moving it to another computer.

- A virtual private network (VPN) uses an encryption protocol (such as IPsec, PPTP, or L2TP) to establish a secure communication channel between two hosts (or between one site and another site). Data that passes through the unsecured network is encrypted and protected.

- When you implement BitLocker on a hard drive and store the startup key in the TPM chip, you can boot the hard drive without providing the startup key. You do not need to provide the key before booting or a USB drive with the key on the drive.

- BitLocker is designed to protect files against offline access only.

- BitLocker To Go provides drive encryption for removable data drives, including USB flash drives. You can use BitLocker To Go to encrypt the data on a flash drive. The only way to decrypt the data on the flash drive is through the recovery password. Using BitLocker To Go and not sharing the recovery password would keep the data on the flash drive secure.

- A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a special hardware chip included on a computer's motherboard that contains software (within the firmware) that generates and stores cryptographic keys.

- BitLocker checks the integrity of the early boot components and the boot configuration data by using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to ensure that the data is accessible only when the computer's boot components appear unaltered. Also, the encrypted disk must be in the same computer it was in when it was originally encrypted with BitLocker. 
   This means that if someone were to obtain that hard drive and put it in a different computer, they wouldn't be able to access the data on that drive. The data stays encrypted.

<h3>9.4.1 Use Linux Shell Commands</h3>
<h3>9.4.2 Linux Shell Facts</h3>
pwd -  Displays the path of the current directory on the screen. pwd stands for print working directory.

ip - Displays or changes IP configuration settings.

ls - Displays a list of files and subdirectories that exist within a directory. Several options are commonly used with this command:
    -a displays all files, including hidden files.
    -l displays a detailed (long) listing of directory contents, including ownership, permissions, modification dates, and file sizes.
    -R displays the contents of the directory and all of its subdirectories.

--help - Displays a brief summary of how to use the command.

bash - Starts a new Bourne-again shell (bash) session.

man - Displays the manual page for a command. It's very similar to the help screen, but it provides more detail. Use the Q key to quit and go back to the shell prompt.

info - Displays more extensive documentation about the command. Use the Q key to quit and go back to the shell prompt.

cd - Changes directories in the file system. For example, to change to the /home directory in the file system, you would enter cd /home at the shell prompt.

cp - Copies files and directories from one location in the file system to another. For example, to copy the widget.odt file to the /home/rsmith directory, you would enter cp widget.odt /home/rsmith at the shell prompt.
    To copy an entire directory structure, include the -R option, which specifies that the directory contents be recursively copied.

mv - Moves and/or renames files and directories from one location or name to another. For example, to move the widget.odt file in your current working directory to the /home/rsmith directory, you would enter mv widget.odt /home/rsmith at the shell prompt. Before moving it, you could rename it to newwidget.odt by entering mv widget.odt newwidget.odt or, alternatively, you could rename and move it simultaneously by entering mv widget.odt /home/rsmith/newwidget.odt.

rm - Deletes files and directories from the file system. For example, to delete the widget.odt file, you would enter rm widget.odt at the shell prompt.

cat - Displays the contents of a text file on the screen. For example, to view the contents of the widget.txt file, you would enter cat widget.txt at the shell prompt.

less - Displays the contents of a text file on the screen, pausing the output one screen at a time. For example, to view the contents of the widget.txt file one page at a time, you would enter less widget.txt at the shell prompt.

head - Displays the first few lines of a text file on the screen. For example, to view the first lines of the widget.txt file, you would enter head widget.txt at the shell prompt.

tail - Displays the last few lines of a text file on the screen. For example, to view the last lines of the widget.txt file, you would enter tail widget.txt at the shell prompt.
    - The -f option can be used with tail to monitor a file for changes. If new content is added to the end of the file (such as a log file), the new lines will be displayed on the screen.

vi/vim - Edits the contents of a text file. Current Linux systems use vim (an improved version of vi). Executing the vi command will launch the vim executable. The vi uses four different operating modes:
Command mode
    - Command line mode
    - Insert mode
    - Replace mode
    For example, to edit the contents of the widget.txt file, you would enter vi widget.txt at the shell prompt. You would then press the i key to enter Insert mode and make the necessary changes to the file. When done editing the file, you would press the Esc key to enter command mode. Then you would press the : key to enter command line mode where you would enter exit or wq (for write and quit) to save your changes and exit the vi editor.

su - Allows you to switch user accounts.
    su - (su with a space and a hyphen) is used to switch to the root user with the home directory and environment variables assigned to the root user.

shutdown - Shuts down or reboots the system in a secure manner. The syntax of the shutdown command is shutdown -h|-r +m message. The options for the shutdown command include:
    +m specifies when to perform the shutdown operation. m is the amount of time (specified in minutes).
    -h instructs the system to shut down and power down.
    -r instructs the system to reboot after the shutdown.
    -p powers off the machine.
    -message specifies a message that is sent to all users that accompanies the standard shutdown notification.

<h3>9.4.6 Edit File Contents</h3>
<h3>9.4.7 Manage Ownership and Permissions</h3>
<h3>9.4.8 Linux File Management Facts</h3>
Second Extended Filesystem (ext2)-	ext2 is one of the oldest Linux file systems still available.
        - ext2 stores data in a standard directory and file hierarchy.
        - It supports a 2 TB maximum file size.
        - An ext2 volume can be up to 4 TB in size.
        - File names can be 255 characters long.
        - ext2 supports Linux users, groups, and permissions.
        - It does not use journaling (which is used in most modern file systems). As a result, recovery takes a long time if the system shuts down abruptly.

Third Extended Filesystem (ext3)- 	ext3 is an updated version of ext2 that supports journaling. Key points include:
        - Before committing a transaction to a storage device, the ext3 file system records the transaction to the journal and marks it as incomplete.
        - After the disk transaction is complete, the file system marks the transaction as complete in the journal.
        - Journaling allows ext3 to track of the most recent file transactions and indicates if they were completed.
        - Journaling allows ext3 to recover much more quickly than ext2 in the event of an unclean system shutdown.

Fourth Extended Filesystem (ext4)- 	ext4 includes all features found with ext2 and ext3. It also:
        - Supports file sizes up to 16 TB and disk sizes up to 1 exabyte (EB).
        - Allows for up to four billion files in the file system.
        - Uses checksums to verify the integrity of the journal file.
            * Checksums help improve the overall reliability of the system because the journal file is the most heavily used file of the disk.

swap- 	 A swap file system is used as virtual memory (the portion of the hard disk used to temporarily store portions of main memory) by the operating system.
            * A recommended practice is to make the swap file size between 1 and 1.5 times the amount of memory on the computer.

Compact Disc File System (CDfs)- 	CDfs is a virtual Linux file system that provides access to individual data and audio tracks on compact discs (CDs). A compact disc mounted with the CDfs driver appears as a collection of files, each representing a single track.

Network File System (NFS)-  	NFS is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.

New Technology File System (NTFS)-  	Microsoft operating systems use NTFS. Linux provides limited support for NTFS.

Virtual File Allocation Table (VFAT)-  	VFAT is a FAT32 file system for Linux. VFAT
        - Does not support journaling.
        - Includes long name support.
        - Requires support for VFAT to be compiled into the kernel for the system to recognize the VFAT format.

Extended File System (XFS)- 	XFS was developed for the Silicon Graphics IRIX operating system. An XFS file system:
        - Proficiently handles large files.
        - Offers smooth data transfers.
        - Provides journaling.
        - Can reside on a regular disk partition or on a logical volume.

B Tree File System (Btrfs)- 	Btrfs is a Linux file system that uses a copy-on-write file system. Using copy-on-write technology, Btrfs provides several key features not found in earlier file systems:
    - Storage pools—Btrfs allows you to create storage pools from the storage devices in the system.
        - From the storage pool, you can allocate space to specific storage volumes.
        - You mount storage volumes at mount points in the file system.
    - Snapshots—The snapshot functionality provided by Btrfs protects data.
        - You can configure it to take snapshots of data at specified intervals and save it on separate media.
        - If a file gets lost or corrupted, you can restore a previous version of the file from a snapshot.

<b>Additional Commands</b>
head - 	Displays the first few lines of a text file on the screen. For example, to view the first lines of the widget.txt file, you enter 'head widget.txt' at the shell prompt.        

chown -	Changes the user or group that owns a file or directory. For example, to change the owner of the widget.txt file to the mlanders user, enter 'chown lmanders widget.txt'.

chgrp - Changes the group that owns a file or directory. For example, to change the group that owns the widget.txt file to the RandD group, enter 'chgrp RandD widget.txt'.

chmod - There are several ways you can use the chmod command to modify the permissions assigned to a file or directory. Syntax options include:
    chmod entity= permissions filename
        - Entity can be:
            - u for Owner
            - g for Group
            - o for Others
        - Permission can be:
            - r for read
            - w for write
            - x for execute
    chmod entity+/- permissions filename
        - Entity can be:
            - u for Owner
            - g for Group
            - o for Others    
        - Permission can be:
            - r for read
            - w for write
            - x for execute
     -r chmod 3-digit_numeric_permission filename. The digits assign permissions as follows:
            - 1 for Owner
            - 2 for Group
            - 3 for Others

dd -   Copies file system data using records. It can copy files, directories, partitions, or even entire hard disks. For example, to copy a disk partition to a file on a removable USB drive, use the syntax:
        - dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/media/usb/partition.bak

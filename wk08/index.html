<h2>8.1 Active Directory</h2>
Policy- 	A set of rules and guidelines that establish the way that business is conducted within an organization.
Workgroup-  	Microsoft's implementation of peer-to-peer networking.
Domain- 	An administratively defined collection of network resources that share a common directory database and security policies.
<h3>8.1.1 Workgroup vs Domain Setup</h3>
  allow you to share printers and files 

workgroup -- peer-to-peer model - each provides and consumes resources 
        workgroups are easy 

    Cons:
        - doesn't scale well 
        - more difficult to backup
        - 

Domain networking - all clients share the server's central Directory Database
    client - server model

        more scalable
        more secure 

    Cons: 
        - cost more
        - cost more to setup in the frontend
        -
<h3>8.1.2 Active Directory Overview</h3>        
centralized database that contains: 
            user accounts
            group objects
            workstation objects
            security information 
            and more...

active directory allows single login
                        centralized management

 ex: <b><i>CoprNet.xyz</i></b> Full DNS Name                 
     CorpNet = Domain name

Domain controller = contains 'active directory' database,  must be a part of the domain and contains information about the domain
        Domain's may contain more than one controller, but each controller can only be part of 1 domain

  replication -- backing up information
  
  orginizational units - logical containers - basically sub-domains for security 
<h3>8.1.3 Join a Domain</h3>  
    demo on joining a domain -- 
in windows -- system properties 
    there are options to rename computer
                         join workgroup 
<h3>8.1.5 Manage Active Directory Objects</h3>
tools -> active directory users and computers
       default it builds: builtin, computers, foreignsecurityprincipals, managed service accounts, and users 'containers'
   you can define additional: 'orginizational units', the Active Directory Server creates a default 'Domain Controllers' orgizational unit
   
orgizational units can perform additional functions than 'containers' in this sense

container objects -  very default in nature - designed to hold the object used by active directory
orgizational units - contain many user accounts, don't accidently delete it 
    
user accounts are the most common active directory objects in an orgizational unit 
    can make a group and assign users group access
<h3>8.1.6 Active Directory Facts</h3>
<b>Active Directory</b> provides the following benefits:

- Centralized resources and security administration—the ability for an administrator to manage and secure the network resources and associated security objects from a single point (the Active Directory database).
- Single logon for access to global resources—a user created on a domain controller can access (from any computer on the network) any resource on the network that the user has been granted access to.
- Simplified resource location—Active Directory simplifies access to files and print resources by allowing files and print resources to be published on the network. Once published, a user can search the Active Directory database for the desired resource and securely access it.

Domain- 	A domain is an administratively defined collection of network resources that share a common directory database and common security policies. The domain is the basic administrative unit of an Active Directory structure.

Organizational unit(OU)- 	An organizational unit is like a folder that subdivides and organizes network resources within a domain.

Built-in containers-	Like OUs, generic built-in containers are used to organize Active Directory objects.

Objects-	Within Active Directory, each resource is identified as an object. Common objects include:
        -Users
        -Groups
        -Computers   

You should know the following about objects:

    -Each object contains attributes that include information about the object itself such as a user's name, phone number, and email address. This information is used for locating and securing resources.
    -Active Directory uses DNS for locating and naming objects.
    -Container objects hold other objects. These can be either other containers or leaf objects.

Domain controller-  	A domain controller is a Windows server that holds a copy of the Active Directory database.    
<h3>8.1.7 Create Users Lab</h3>
<h3>8.1.8 Create OUs Lab</h3>
<h3>8.1.9 Delete OUs Lab</h3>
    ** if the OU was created with deletion protection on, then you must:
        1) go to 'View' in the Active Directory User bar at the top
        2) choose 'Advanced Options'
        3) navigate to the OU you want to delete 
        4) right-click the OU to delete and choose 'properties'
        5) on the 'object' tab you can uncheck the 'protect from delete'
        6) apply
        7) OU can now be deleted by right-clicking and choosing delete; or by selecting and using the 'delete' button on the bar up top 
<h3>8.1.10 Group Policy</h3>        
<h3>8.1.11 Use Group Policy</h3>
  Local group policy vs group policy
<h3>8.1.12 Group Policy Facts</h3>
 - You can link GPOs to Active Directory domains and organizational units (OUs). Built-in containers (such as the Computers container) and folders cannot have GPOs linked to them.
 - A GPO applied to an OU affects the objects in the OU and all sub-OUs.
 - A GPO applied to a domain affects all objects within all OUs.
 - A local GPO is stored on a local machine. Computers that are not part of a domain use the Local Group Policy settings to control security settings and other restrictions on the computer.
 - GPOs are applied in the following order:
        - In relation to the Local Group Policy on the computer.
        - In relation to GPOs linked to the domain that contain the user or computer object.
        - In relation to GPOs linked to the organizational unit(s) that contains the object (from the highest-level OU to the lowest-level OU).
 - A specific setting in a GPO can be set in the following ways:
        - Not Configured indicates the GPO has no value for that setting and does not change the current setting.
        - Enabled indicates the GPO identifies a value to enforce.
 - Individual settings within all GPOs are combined to form the effective Group Policy setting as follows:
        - If a setting is defined in one GPO and undefined in another, the defined setting is enforced (regardless of the position of the GPO in the application order).
        - If a setting is configured in two GPOs, the setting in the last applied GPO is used.

gpedit.msc- 	This command opens the Local Group Policy Editor.
gpupdate-	This command forces a computer to ask the domain controller for new or updated group policy objectives. These updates usually occur automatically, but on occasion, you may need to force the updates to a computer.
gpresult- 	This command displays a listing of the group policy objects that have been applied to the computer and the user.        
<h3>8.1.13 Quiz Facts</h3>
- The Active Directory structure contains the following components:
    - A domain is a collection of network resources that share a common directory database.
    - An organizational unit (OU) is a folder-like container that organizes network resources.
    - A built-in container is a default container used to organize Active Directory objects. It cannot be deleted.
    - An object is a resource within Active Directory.
    - A domain controller is a Windows server that holds a copy of the Active Directory database.

- The Computer Name tab lets you view, change, or join a computer to a domain.

- the branch office in each country is organized similarly, the best recommendation would be to use departmental OUs at the top with office (country) OUs underneath. You could then create resource containers under each office. 
    You could then easily utilize group accounts to assign resource rights to specific roles departmentally as the company hires more employees.

- network is not growing, a Windows workgroup lets you organize your computers in a peer-to-peer network. This workgroup network lets you share files, internet access, and printers between the five employees.

- Administrative Templates are Registry-based settings that you can configure within a GPO to control a computer system and its overall user experience. They include the ability to do things like control notifications and restrict access to Control Panel features.

- GPOs linked to organizational units that contain this user's object to see where the Hide Programs and Features Page policy might be enabled.

- Each policy can be configured using one of the settings listed below.
    - Not Configured has no value and does not change the current setting for this policy.
    - Enabled causes the policy to be enforced.
    - Disabled prevents the policy from being enforced.

- In this question's scenario, Local Group Policy enables the policy to hide the Programs and Features page. When the Default Domain Policy GPO is applied, this policy is set to Not configured, so it doesn't change anything. When the GPO linked to the user's organizational
    unit is applied, the setting for this policy is disabled, which reverses the setting in the Local Group Policy and makes the Programs and Features page visible to the user. The Local Group Policy is applied first. GPOs linked to the user's domain are applied second and 
    take precedence over settings in the Local Group Policy. GPOs linked to the user's organizational unit are applied last and take precedence over any preceding policy settings.    

- The Local Group Policy Editor is the administrative tool you can use to enable local computer behavior policies and the tasks that users are allowed to perform. The policy that turns off the Windows Store application is found under Computer Configuration settings.    
<h2>8.2 Users and Groups</h2>
User account-	An account that identifies a specific user. You can assign rights and permissions to a user's account.
Group- 	A collection of user accounts you can use to assign rights and permissions to multiple users.
<h3>8.2.1 </h3>
** skipping to just doing labs and quizzes cause i'm low on time **

<h3>8.2.8 Manage Users and Groups</h3>
    - right-click start and go to 'computer management'
    - expand 'local users and groups'
    - right-click user and 'add new user'
    - enter username
    - enter password
    - confirm 'change password at next login' is checked
    - select 'create'

   -- make sylvia 'admin'
   -- make scott 'backup operator'
   -- jed is 'users' group 
<h3>8.2.11 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Many Windows features or third-party applications create additional groups in order to access rights and permissions. 
    If you delete the group, the application probably won't launch or work properly.

- Members of the Users group are not allowed to make system-wide changes, such as installing new applications. Only users who are members of the Administrators group can install new applications.

- A Windows group is used to identify groups of user accounts that have similar access needs. Group members have the permissions and rights assigned to the group. Using groups simplifies administration. 
  Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user account, you can assign permissions to the group and then make user accounts members of that group.

- Windows Hello requires you to set up a PIN before you can register a facial or fingerprint scan for your account.

- If you are using a computer with a TPM chip, it is automatically configured for a set number of failed PIN attempts (about 10) before lockout (you do not need to set this up). 
   If your laptop does not have a TPM chip, you can set up BitLocker for lockout after several failed PIN attempts.

- Active Directory uses the single sign-on (SSO) process to simplify how users sign in to all the systems and applications that they need. When a user logs in, their credentials are authenticated with the 
    authentication server. When the user visits a trusted resource, the authentication server vouches for the user, and the resource allows them access.   

- The Sign in with a Microsoft account instead option lets you associate your local user account with your online Microsoft account.
        - The Manage my accounts option lets you manage your user accounts, but does not provide an option to associate your local user account with your online Microsoft account.
        - You can use the Family & other users option to allocate a specific number of hours for screen time, enforce content filters, and receive activity reporting for specific family members.
        - Users and Groups is a snap-in that is used in the Computer Management tool to manage user accounts.    

- When a standard user logs on, a standard user token is created. But when an administrator logs on, two access tokens are created. Windows creates a standard user token, and then Windows also creates an administrator token.

- When you select the Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop) option, the following happens:
        - Notifications occur when programs make changes.
        - Notifications do not occur when you make changes.
        - The desktop is not dimmed, which means Secure Desktop is disabled.
<h2>8.3 Remote Services</h2>
<h3>8.3.1 Remote Access Technologies</h3>
** skipping to the labs and quizzes **
<h3>8.3.9 Configure Remote Services Lab</h3>
    -Verify the firewall port configuration.
        -From the left pane, select Privacy & security.
        -From the right pane, select Windows Security.
        -Select Open Windows Security.
        -Select Firewall & network protection.
        -Select Allow an app through firewall.
        -Scroll down and verify that Remote Desktop is selected, 
           indicating that the port is opened.
<h3>8.3.12 Quiz Facts</h3>
- Screen Sharing is built into macOS.

- Remote management and monitory (RMM) software lets you perform tasks remotely, such as analyzing activity and receiving automated alerts for unusual device activity. An RMM is the best solution in this scenario.

- Remote Desktop provides a remote user with full access to the graphical desktop of a Windows system. This allows them to run programs, manipulate files, and restart or power down the computer (just like a regular user).

- Using waiting room features and a strong password can best help you secure your video conferencing software.

- users who are members of the Administrators or Remote Desktop Users groups are allowed to establish Remote Desktop connections with a Windows system. You can use either group. However, in this scenario, the best option would probably be to make her a member of the Remote Desktop Users
      group instead of Administrators to avoid granting her too many permissions and rights.

- In order for you to connect to the employee's desktop using Remote Desktop, all other remote connections must be inactive. Because this is an escalated issue from a Level 1 operator, it is highly likely that the Remote Desktop connection between the Level 1 operator and the employee's desktop has not been disconnected.
            Remote Desktop opens TCP port 3389 and allows RDP traffic

- The best approach is to instruct the employee to establish a Remote Assistance or Quick Assist session to watch what he is doing. In the session, you could also take control and show the employee how to complete the task.

- With Remote Assistance, the user initiates the session.
    - Remote Assistance allows both the user and the remote user to be logged in at the same time. Remote Desktop only allows one user (such as the remote user) to be logged in at a time.
    - Remote Assistance is designed to provide or receive remote help. Remote Desktop is designed for user productivity.

- the administrator cannot access the Screen Sharing session is that Rachel has the Specific Users Only option selected, and the administrator is not listed as a user that can access her iMac.

<h3>8.4.3 VPN Facts</h3>
Virtual private network-  a type of network that uses encryption to securely send IP traffic over the TCP/IP network. A VPN is used primarily to support secure communications over an untrusted network.

You can implement VPNs in the following ways:
    -With a host-to-host VPN, two hosts establish a secure channel and communicate directly. In this configuration, both devices must be capable of creating the VPN connection.
    -With a site-to-site VPN, routers on the edge of each site establish a VPN with the router at the other location. Data from hosts within the site are encrypted before being sent to the other site. With this configuration, individual hosts are unaware of the VPN.
    -With a remote access VPN, a server on the edge of a network (called a VPN concentrator) is configured to accept VPN connections from individual hosts in a client-to-site configuration. Hosts that are allowed to connect using the VPN connection are granted access to resources on the VPN server or the private network.

Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)- 	PPTP was developed by Microsoft as one of the first VPN protocols. PPTP:
        -Uses standard authentication protocols, such as CHAP and PAP.
        -Supports only TCP/IP.
        -Is supported by most operating systems and servers.
        -Uses TCP port 1723.

Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)-	L2TP is an open standard for secure multiprotocol routing. L2TP:
        -Supports multiple protocols (not just IP).
        -Uses IPsec for encryption.
        -Is not supported by older operating systems.
        -Uses TCP port 1701 and UDP port 500.

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)- 	IPsec provides authentication and encryption. You can use it in conjunction with L2TP or by itself as a VPN solution. IPsec includes the following three protocols for authentication, data encryption, and connection negotiation:
        -Authentication Header (AH) enables authentication with IPsec.
        -Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides data encryption.
        -Internet Key Exchange (IKE) negotiates the connection.
    IPsec can secure the following types of communications:
        -Host-to-host communications within a LAN.
        -VPN communications through the internet, either by itself or in conjunction with the L2TP VPN protocol.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)- 	The SSL protocol has long been used to secure traffic generated by IP protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and email. You can also use SSL as a VPN solution, typically in a remote access scenario. SSL:
        -Authenticates the server to the client using public key cryptography and digital certificates.
        -Encrypts the entire communication session.
        -Uses port 443, which is already open on most firewalls.

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)-	GRE is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco. You can use GRE to route any Layer 3 protocol across an IP network. GRE:
        -Creates a tunnel between two routers.
        -Encapsulates packets by adding a GRE header and a new IP header to the original packet.
        -Does not offer any type of encryption.
        -Can be paired with other protocols, such as IPsec or PPTP, to create a secure VPN connection.

** Ports must be open in firewalls to allow VPN protocols. For this reason, using SSL for the VPN often works through firewalls when other solutions do not. Additionally, some NAT solutions do not work well with VPN connections. **        
<h3>8.4.4 Configure VPN Lab</h3>
<h3>8.4.5 VPN Quiz Facts</h3>
- It is generally considered acceptable to use a VPN connection to securely transfer data over an open Wi-Fi network. As long as strong tunneling ciphers and protocols are used, the VPN provides sufficient encryption to secure the connection
   even though the wireless network itself is not encrypted. It is recommended that you use IPsec or SSL to secure the VPN, as these protocols are relatively secure. You should also configure the browser's HTTPS requests to go through the VPN connection.

- While L2TP, IPSec, and SSL are VPN protocols, GRE is a tunneling protocol that was developed by Cisco and can be used to route any Layer 3 protocol across an IP network.

- PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is used with VPNs, which allow you to send data securely over a public network.
    - PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is used by PPTP to provide encryption and authentication of data packets. However, PPTP is used with a VPN to provide the actual VPN tunneling.
    - SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) is an encapsulation of Internet Protocol that is designed to work over serial ports and router connections. SLIP is not a protocol used by a VPN.
    - NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface) is an extended version of NetBIOS, the program that lets computers communicate within a local area network. NetBEUI is not a VPN protocol.

- While L2TP, IPSec, and SSL are VPN protocols, PPTP was developed by Microsoft as one of the first VPN protocols. PPTP only supports TCP/IP.

- An SSL VPN uses the SSL protocol to secure communications. An SSL VPN:
        - Authenticates the server to the client using public key cryptography and digital certificates.
        - Encrypts the entire communication session.
        - Uses port 443, which is already open on most firewalls.
    
    - IPsec uses pre-shared keys to provide authentication with other protocols. IPsec also uses HMAC to provide message integrity checks. 
    - GRE headers are used exclusively by the GRE tunneling protocol. 
    - UDP port 500 works with Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP).

- PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) are two VPN (virtual private network) protocols that let you access your company's network through a public network, such as the internet.

     -PPPoE is used for connecting to the internet through an Ethernet connection and includes authentication and accounting.
     -VNC and RDP are remote desktop protocols for remote administration and remote device access.     
    
- With a remote access VPN, a server on the edge of a network (called a VPN concentrator) is configured to accept VPN connections from individual hosts. Hosts that are allowed to connect using the VPN connection are 
    granted access to resources on the VPN server or the private network.

- A virtual private network (VPN) is an encrypted tunnel between remote users and a private network.

    - Data loss prevention (DLP) programs monitor operations such as file transfers and emails for user activity that could compromise data security.
    - An access control list contains users and groups that are granted access to files, folders, and other resources.
    - Firewalls are usually placed between a company's network and the internet to filter network traffic at the IP level. VPNs are what usually tunnel through these firewalls. In some cases, both functions may be available on one device.

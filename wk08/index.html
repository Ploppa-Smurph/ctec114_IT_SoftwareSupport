<h2>8.1 Active Directory</h2>
Policy- 	A set of rules and guidelines that establish the way that business is conducted within an organization.
Workgroup-  	Microsoft's implementation of peer-to-peer networking.
Domain- 	An administratively defined collection of network resources that share a common directory database and security policies.
<h3>8.1.1 Workgroup vs Domain Setup</h3>
  allow you to share printers and files 

workgroup -- peer-to-peer model - each provides and consumes resources 
        workgroups are easy 

    Cons:
        - doesn't scale well 
        - more difficult to backup
        - 

Domain networking - all clients share the server's central Directory Database
    client - server model

        more scalable
        more secure 

    Cons: 
        - cost more
        - cost more to setup in the frontend
        -
<h3>8.1.2 Active Directory Overview</h3>        
centralized database that contains: 
            user accounts
            group objects
            workstation objects
            security information 
            and more...

active directory allows single login
                        centralized management

 ex: <b><i>CoprNet.xyz</i></b> Full DNS Name                 
     CorpNet = Domain name

Domain controller = contains 'active directory' database,  must be a part of the domain and contains information about the domain
        Domain's may contain more than one controller, but each controller can only be part of 1 domain

  replication -- backing up information
  
  orginizational units - logical containers - basically sub-domains for security 
<h3>8.1.3 Join a Domain</h3>  
    demo on joining a domain -- 
in windows -- system properties 
    there are options to rename computer
                         join workgroup

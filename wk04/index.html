    <h2>4.1 Operating Systems</h2>
    Graphical user interface(GUI)-	A software program that uses icons, menus, and other visual components to interact with and control a computer's or electric device's resources.
    End of life-    The term vendors use to notify users that support, updates, and patches for an operating system or software will no longer be provided by the vendor.
    Operating system kernel-	The most basic component of an operating system. The kernel runs the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.
    <h3>4.1.1 Workstation OS</h3>
        software that allows you to use computers memory, file system, processes, hardware, software, applications
            normally uses GUI (graphic user interface)
        Windows - started in 1985, home, pro additional features, enterprise edition
        macOS - 2001 macOS started
        Linux - open source UNIX like system -- free distributions first released in 1991
           Kernel - runs, CPU, memory, and peripheral
        Chrome OS - simplified cloud base usage       
    <h3>4.1.2 Workstation OS Facts</h3>
    <h2>4.2 Windows Basics</h2>
    Operating system(OS)-	A set of programs that manages system functions, the applications that are running on a computer and the computer's hardware.
    Kernel-	The core of the operating system that is loaded into memory when the system boots.
    Driver-	A type of computer program that enables the operating system to interact with hardware devices.
    Interface-	A type of computer program that allows the user to interact with the kernel and the utilities.
    Utilities-	The features or programs included with an operating system that perform system-related tasks.
    Application-	A subclass computer program that is designed for end users.
    <h3>4.2.1 Windows OS</h3>
        communicates between hardware and applications --
         OS moderates hardware -- allows apps to acces the hardware without doing a lot of work
        provides Security - database of users accounts and login passwords

        1st) Kernel - performs most of the jobs, manages file system, security
        2nd) Utilities - part of the OS, interacts with Kernel
        3rd) Interface - a. CLI - command line -
                         b. GUI - graphical user interface - 
    <h3>4.2.2 Windows OS Facts</h3>
    An operating system is a set of programs that act as an interface between the applications that are running on a computer and the computer's hardware. Operating systems perform actions such as:

        -Receive user input from devices such as the keyboard or mouse.
        -Send user output to devices such as the monitor or a printer.
        -Control processing devices by applications.
        -Serve as a platform for applications.
        -Moderate hardware.
        -Provide security.
        -Manage the file system.
    
    Some operating systems also have following attributes.
    
        -Multiprocessing—the ability to use multiple central processing units (CPUs) in a single system.
        -Multitasking—the ability to run multiple applications simultaneously. Two common variations are:
            -Cooperative multitasking—requires multiple processes to work together for the operating system to work effectively.
            -Preemptive multitasking—forces applications to share the CPU.
        -Multithreading—the ability to run multiple parts of an application simultaneously.

    <h2>4.3 Linux Basics</h2>
        Linux-	An open-source operating system.
        Distribution-	A custom version of Linux.
        Shell-	A command line interface.
    <h3>4.3.1 Linux OS</h3>
    <h3>4.3.2 Navigate Linux GUI</h3>
    <h3>4.3.3 Linux Facts</h3>
    Application platform-	The operating system provides a platform that applications can run on.
    Hardware interface-	A key function of the operating system is to ensure that an application running on the system does not try to use an area in memory that's already in use by another application. The OS is also responsible for ensuring that an application running on the system does not monopolize the CPU, preventing other running applications on the system from using the CPU.
    Data storage-	The operating system is responsible for providing an efficient and reliable means for storing data. This is usually done using some type of storage device, such as a hard disk drive formatted with a particular file system. The file system's job is to organize the information on the hard disk in an easily retrievable format.
    Security-	The operating system is responsible for providing some degree of security for the data that's stored on its storage devices. For example, the system administrator can create rules and assign permissions that determine who can access what information on the system.
    Network connectivity-	The operating system provides connectivity between computer systems over a network connection. They do this using a variety of network media and interfaces, such as an Ethernet connection between computer systems. There are other standards that can create network connections, such as mobile broadband wireless or Wi-Fi wireless.
    <h2>4.4 macOS Basics</h2>
    MacOS-	A proprietary closed-source, operating system designed by Apple, Inc.
    Apple File System (APFS)-	The default file system for Mac computers using macOS 10.13 or later.
    <h3>4.4.1 macOS Intro</h3>

            -Devices on the same network can access the shared remote CD or DVD.
            -You can access only data CDs and DVDs. You can't remotely access media discs such as audio CDs; Blu-ray and DVD movies; or installation discs.
    Boot Camp:	Boot Camp is a Mac OS feature that allows an Apple device to install the Microsoft Windows OS. The Boot Camp Assistant app makes installing Windows a simple process. The Boot Camp Assistant:
            -Creates a BOOTCAMP partition on the hard drive and prepares it for installing Windows automatically.
            -Reboots the system and starts the Windows install process from the selected installation media.
            -Creates a Boot Camp system tray icon in both Mac OS and the Windows installation to switch between the Windows and Mac OS.
        -Boot Camp has the following system requirements:
            -Intel-based Mac
            -Installation media containing 64-bit version of Windows 8 or later
            -55 GB of free space
    System Preferences:	You use the System Preferences utility to change most Mac OS settings.

            -Each category has multiple tabs or dialogs to change system settings.
            -You can use the search box to search for the location of a specific setting.
    Mission Control:	Mission Control is a desktop and application window management utility used to access several Mac OS features.
            -Multiple Desktops: At the top of Mission Control is the Multiple Desktops feature you can use to manage and navigate between multiple desktops.
            -All Windows: When activated, Mission Control tiles all application windows on the screen and groups multiple windows from the same application together.
            -Dashboard: From Mission Control, you can access the Dashboard containing Mac OS widgets.
    Keychain:	Keychain is Mac OS's password management utility. Keychain can hold password-protected data for the following categories:

    Dock:	The Dock is the main taskbar in Mac OS. You use the Dock to launch apps, switch between running apps, access the Trash, and access specific folders. You can:
            -Access dock settings in System Preferences or by right-clicking the Dock and selecting Dock Preferences.
            -Pin apps and folders to the Dock for quick access.
            -Recognize running apps on the Dock by the illuminated dot below them.
    Force Quit:	You use Force Quit to stop non-responsive processes and applications. You can also use it to restart the Finder service. You access Force Quit from the Apple menu or the keyboard shortcut Command + Option + Esc.
    Terminal:	Terminal is Mac OS's command line interface utility. It is similar to the terminal used in Linux systems. Terminal:
            -Uses many of the same commands as the Linux terminal.
            -Can be used to perform system management tasks, such as deleting files, changing permissions, etc.

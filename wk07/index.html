    Impact Considerations
    Manage from : Windows Settings -> Apps 
            or    Control Panel -> Programs        
<h3>7.4.2 Manage Windows Applications</h3>
    installing a new app
        double click the .exe & grant permissions
        choose where to install
        accept user agreement
<h3>7.4.3 Manage Windows Applications Facts</h3>
    - Installation typically modifies the registry, creates shortcuts, and configures other settings required by the application.
    - Installation of an application usually creates a tile on the Start menu and may also create a shortcut on the desktop. A shortcut is a pointer file that identifies the location of the executable file that runs the application.
        -Shortcuts that point to removable drives (such as CD/DVD drives) or network drives could become unavailable if the referenced drive is disconnected.
        -During installation, you can often choose to add shortcuts for only the current user or all users.
        -The shortcut also identifies a directory that the application uses or references when it first starts. You can modify the directory by changing the Start in property for the shortcut or executable file.
      =By default, applications are installed into the Program Files directory on the root of the system drive.
        -During installation, you typically can specify an alternate install location.
        -64-bit operating system versions include an additional folder named Program Files (x86). 32-bit applications are installed into this folder.
      =Users must have the correct permissions or rights to install applications. The ability to install applications depends on the user's group membership and the operating system:

Users-	Users who are members of only the Users group are not able to install applications. If you're signed into a limited account, you see a dialog box asking you to enter an administrative password.
Administrators-	 Only people with administrative privileges can install programs in Windows 10. If you're already logged on with an administrative account, Windows 10 asks you if you want to allow the program to make changes to the computer.

    -In some cases, users require special privileges or rights to run applications. For example, legacy applications that access the system in certain ways may require running the application as an administrator.
    -Copying an application's shortcut to the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder will cause that application to be automatically launched every time the system is booted. You can also use Task Scheduler to configure an application to run automatically based upon event triggers that you define.
    -Many applications as they run create data files (such as documents or video files), and might also require creating temporary files. The user must have sufficient permissions to the directories where the data and temporary files are created.

        Which yum command searches online repositories for a particular package, downloads it, and installs it?
        Which yum command downloads and installs the latest updates for packages installed on the system?
        Which apt-get or apt command uninstalls a package from the system?
        Which apt-get or apt command updates all the installed packages on a system?
        Which option can you use with the ps command to view all processes running on the system?
        How can you get help with a Linux command?
<h3>7.5.1 Install Linux Software</h3>
    differ depending on distributions. 
        Debian uses apt-get / apt  --> bundled as .deb package
        Fedora / Redhat --> bundled as .rpm package  
        
    the installation will install additional dependencies
        -repositories 
<h3>7.5.2 Manage Apps on Linux</h3>    
        using graphic interface -- and ubuntu software store 
           search in the software store
             -- most apps will need permissions to install
    you can remove apps in the software store, also --> go to installed tab and remove any apps you don't want         
<h3>7.5.3 Manage Processes on Linux</h3>
    ps utility
        $ ps

        displays all processes that are running in the current terminal

        PID - process ID
        TTY - Shell name and process
        Time - time process has run
        CMD - name of command to run the process

    $ ps -e   [shows all process on the system]
       this will give you more information
         many TTY will show ? if you run 'ps -e' becasue the process isn't running in a shell, they are in the background
    
    $ ps -ef       [will display PPID = Parent Process ID] -- the parent process can launch additional process

    $ ps -elf       [display long format with additional information] -- shows state, WCHAN, ADDR, PRI (Priority) 
<h3>7.5.4 Linux App Facts</h3>    
yum-	The yum command installs packages on Linux systems that use the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM). The yum command can automatically locate and download RPM packages for you by searching one or more repositories on the internet. It can install the package and all its dependencies at the same time.

    The syntax for using yum is as follows:
        -yum install package_name installs the specified package.
        -yum remove package_name uninstalls the specified package.
        -yum list installed lists all packages installed.
        -yum list installed package_name checks to see if the specified package is installed.
        -yum list available displays a list of all packages available for installation within the internet repositories yum is configured to use.

<h3>7.6.3 </h3>
Proprietary-	The proprietary licensing model is used by many software vendors. Each vendor you purchase a proprietary license from should provide an End User License Agreement (EULA) that dictates the specific terms for that software title.

        There are several key facts that you need to remember about proprietary software licensing:
            -When you purchase this type of software, you are not purchasing the software itself. Instead, you are purchasing a license to use the software.
            -You are not allowed to access the software's source code and make modifications. Usually, the source code is not made available to customers. A EULA does not typically allow you to reverse engineer the software to recreate the source code.
            -The license usually permits you to install the software only on a fixed number of computers. Installation limits are commonly enforced by the software vendor using online software activation. If you try to use the same activation code too many times, the software will not activate and can't be used.
        
        Two different, general types of licenses are usually offered by software vendors:
            -Personal licenses are intended for home and small business customers.
                -Usually, the license allows the software to be installed on only one to three systems.
                -Because they are limited in the number of allowed installs, personal licenses are usually less expensive than alternatives.
                -Personal licenses may not be the best choice for large organizations, which may need to purchase hundreds or even thousands of licenses for a given software title.
            -Enterprise licenses (which are also sometimes called volume licenses or corporate use licenses) are intended for medium and large organizations.
                -Enterprise licenses allow the customer to install the software without restriction using the same activation code (typically until a maximum cap is reached).
                -Because of the volume involved, the customer is usually able to purchase an enterprise license for much less than the cost of purchasing individual personal licenses.
                -Enterprise licenses are usually too expensive for most home or small business users.
Open Source-	In the past, open source software was exclusive to Linux and Unix operating systems. However, many open source applications are now available for Windows and Mac operating systems. Open source licensing is very different from proprietary licensing:
            -Open source software is usually freely distributed. You can typically download, install, and use the software without paying a license fee.
            -Most open source software is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which requires that the source code for the software be freely distributable to anyone who wants it. This means you can download the source code for an application, modify it, recompile it, and then use the modified version of the software. You can even post it for others to use if you make your source code freely available as well.
    
    Organizations that release open source applications typically use a variety of means to generate revenue so they can keep developing new products:
            -Contributions - Some open source projects ask you to contribute financially if you use their software.
            -Added functionality - Some open source projects release a base version of their software for free and charge a fee for highly desirable add-ons.
            -Support contracts - Some open source projects release their software for free and charge a fee for technical support.
            -Training contracts - Like support contracts, some open source projects also provide training for a fee.
            -Partnerships - Sometimes an open source project partners with a commercial organization. In this situation, two versions of an application are created, one that is proprietary and one that is open source. The proprietary version is typically used to finance the development of the free version.
            -Subscriptions - Sometimes an open source project sells subscriptions for online accounts or server access.                                                


Copy protection-	Copy protection is used to prevent materials from unauthorized copying. This includes the following technologies:
            -Encryption - Makes digital materials accessible only through authorized decryption software or devices.
            -Fingerprinting - Identifies unique properties of a file and compares them to a database of fingerprinted files to track access to materials.
            -Digital watermarks - Embed traceable information into the file.
            
Permission management-	Permission management is also used to control access and distribution. This includes the following technologies:
            -User authentication - Requires authentication credentials from an authorized user to access materials.
            -IP address authentication - Restricts access to specific authorized IP addresses.
            -Licenses - Restrict access to those systems that have gone through the proper activation process. Licenses use activation codes. Key facts are:
                -Online activation typically works by requiring the user to:
                    -Install the program.
                    -Use the vendor provided access code to activate the program online.
                    -Use only the number of activations permitted by the purchased license.
                -Two forms of online software activation are used by software vendors:
                    -One-time activation - The license is activated once, usually right after the product is installed. Once activated, the product remains activated.
                    -Persistent activation - The license is continuously re-activated online at specified intervals. This allows the software vendor to deactivate installations if the conditions of the license agreement have been violated.
                -Using online activation helps software vendors ensure their products are used in compliance with the license agreement. However, it also has several drawbacks that require you to contact the vendor to reactivate the software:
                    -Online activation mechanisms can fail if an internet connection isn't available.
                    -A small system change can deactivate the software. For example, adding RAM to the system or upgrading the CPU could cause the activation system to think the application has been illegally copied to a new computer system.

<h3>7.8.2 Troubleshooting Windows pt 1 facts</h3>                                             
    Startup Repair-	 This tool fixes damaged or missing system files, which can stop the boot process.

                - Startup Repair can fix only certain problems, such as replacing any missing or corrupt systems files that might be preventing Windows from booting.
    
    System Restore-	 This tool lets you revert the system back to a previously created restore point. A restore point is like a snapshot of the computer's settings and data at a moment in time.

                - System Restore does not change files like documents, photos, or email. If Windows stops working properly, this tool can be helpful to go back to a restore point when it was working properly.
    
    System Image Recovery-	This tool installs a complete image of the Windows system including the operating system, the settings, personal files, hardware drivers, and software.

                - This option is available only if you have previously created a system image and saved it to an external drive.
    
    Uninstall Updates-	This tool allows you to roll back or uninstall a previously installed Windows update.

    Restart services-	Services are low-level tasks that run in the background with no user interaction and should begin automatically with startup. Important services that are not running properly can result in OS problems.

            - Services can be managed using the Windows Services app. One way to open the Windows Services app is by typing 'services' in Windows search and then selecting the Services app from the Best match options.

    From the Services app you can:
            - See the services that are set to start automatically and those that are set to start manually.
            - Right-click the application and select either Restart Stop, Start, Pause, and Resume.
You can check for errors relating to a service using Event Viewer.

Use System File Checker-	Corrupted system files can cause:
                                -Boot problems
                                -Slow performance
                                -Inability to open a file
                                -Unexpected shutdowns
                                -Error screens
            System File Checker is a utility that scans the operating system files, and (when possible) replaces corrupted, altered, or incorrect files.

            To run System File Checker:
                -Open Windows Terminal (Admin). This opens PowerShell.
                -At the PowerShell prompt, type:
                -'DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth' and press Enter
            Once the above has been completed:
                -Type 'sfc /scannow' at the PowerShell prompt.
                -Press Enter.
                -Watch for the message: The operation completed successfully.

Rebuild Windows profiles-	If a user profile becomes corrupted it will prevent the user from accessing Windows.

                Troubleshooting options are:
                    -Rebuild the profile:
                        -Type 'regedit' in Windows search bar.
                        -Open Registry Editor.
                        -Rename any corrupted files names.
                    -Create a new profile:
                        -Create a restore point.
                        -Delete corrupted files from the registry.
                        -Copy and paste clean files from the previous profile.
            
Uninstall/reinstall/update applications-	Conflicts between applications and the operating system can cause Windows to have problems.
                
                Steps to troubleshoot application conflicts are:
                    1)Check the application's system requirements for compatibility.
                    2)Check for updates in:
                        -Windows
                        -The application
                        -The application's drivers
                If these steps do not resolve the conflicts, uninstalling the application and reinstalling it often resolves the conflict.
                
Add resources-	When the system is running sluggishly or applications often hang, it may be a resource issue.
                
                Low memory warnings can indicate the RAM is insufficient. To troubleshoot inadequate RAM:
                
                    -Close any unnecessary programs.
                    -Configure the virtual memory to have greater capacity.
                    -Check for malware.
                    -Add more RAM.
                
                Adding more RAM by itself may not increase the speed of a sluggish system because increased RAM may need more processing power to go with it. Upgrading the CPU when you add RAM can improve system performance.
                
                Keep in mind when upgrading the CPU, the more cores a CPU has, the more processing it can do at once (increasing performance).

<h3>7.8.4 Troubleshooting Windows part 2</h3>           
Software-based causes-	System instability and the black screen of death can come from the following possible software sources.
            -Malware can corrupt drivers or system files. Be sure to keep anti-malware up to date.
            -New updates can cause system instability. Rollback or uninstall new updates that cause errors.
            -Outdated drivers.
            -Outdated applications.
            -Outdated Windows software. Update drivers, applications, and Windows regularly.

Hardware-based causes-	System instability and the black screen of death can come from the following possible hardware sources:
            -Overheated hard drive.
            -Overheated hardware.
                -Make sure ventilation areas are clean and unrestricted.
                -Listen for a functioning fan.
            -Peripheral device malfunctioning. Unplug all peripherals except the keyboard and mouse. Plug each device in one at a time to find the faulty device.
            -Hardware failure.
                -Perform a hardware diagnostic test to identify the problem.
                -Backup regularly to avoid data loss.
            -Loose hardware (RAM chips, hard drives, data cables, etc.). Secure any loose chips, drives, or cables.

            Some facts to understand about USB ports include:

    USB ports use endpoints.
         -Endpoints are data buffers that aid in communication between the USB device and the host.
         -Endpoints allow traffic in only one direction.
         -Endpoints come in pairs: one outgoing endpoint and one incoming endpoint.
      -3.0 USB ports are limited to 16 endpoint pairs and are faster than 2.0 USB ports.
      -2.0 USB ports are limited to 32 endpoint pairs and are slower than 3.0 USB ports.            

Time drift is the condition that occurs when the Windows system time is out of sync with the server. Indicators of a time drift problem include:

Use case-   An example of how a technology can be used in a real-life example.
<h3>7.9.1 Scripting</h3>
    python, java script visual basic script
      -- usually human readable 
      -- can automates task

   an interpreted language 
       read and executed line by line 
       
    human readable 

    python - high level readable code, used for datasets -- popular in scientific 

    Shell Scripting - each has the own syntax -- borne shell (sh) is the base
        also 'bash' = borne again shell

    formerly batch files. 
    
    powershell is popular for scripting and has done away with batch files. 

    used to restart systems 
    map or remap network drives
    backup data
    install apps on multiple systems at 1 time
    add multiple users to a system using a database using powershell

Scripting Considerations 
        -- inadverdent system changes 
        -- online services may change and script would no longer be valid 
        -- test in closed environment and log 
<h3>7.9.2 Scripting Types</h3>   
vbscript, jscript, and powershell 

<b>PowerShell</b> = command line shell and scripting language all in one 
        take cmdlets and wrap them together to perform tasks. 

    update the execution policy:
    $ Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
    
<b>bash</b> Linux uses bash the most -- and can use python scripts

update linux execution policy to allow scripts: 
        $ chmod u+x dir_exists.sh   or  $ 

macOS has zshell or bash -- structure is identical to linux
<h3>7.9.3 Scripting Uses</h3>
    automation- adding user accounts [large new hires at one time] 
    updating- script to patch or update
    restarting machines- script to remotely restart machine 
    gather system information-  
<h3>7.9.4 Scripting Facts</h3>
Python-   Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming with a focus on code readability. It is used extensively with large data sets and is very popular with the scientific community. It can also be extended, which allows new features or specific functions to be added to its toolbox. The file extension for a Python script is usually .py.
Shells-   In the Linux and Unix world, the most popular method of scripting is shell scripting. Although there are several languages that fall under the term shell scripting, the most common forms of shell scripting include:
        -Bourne Shell (sh)—the most commonly used
        -Bourne Again Shell (bash)
        -Korn Shell (ksh)
        -Z Shell (zsh).
    Each shell has its own syntax variation, but all are directly related to the Bourne Shell. Shell scripts are extensively used for automation and maintenance in Linux. The file extension for a shell script is usually .sh.

Batch Files-   Although not technically a scripting language, batch files (.bat) can collect multiple Windows commands and execute them in turn. With the introduction of PowerShell, batch files have become less common, but they’re still used. The file extension for a batch file is .bat.

PowerShell-	  PowerShell started as a Windows-specific tool used to leverage Windows APIs to perform tasks. It has grown to include many common scripting functions. It has greatly increased Windows automation capabilities. The file extension for PowerShell scripts is .ps1.

Visual Basic script (VBScript)-   VBScript is a Windows-specific language used by systems administrators and web developers. Although VBScript was very popular is previous versions of Windows, it has been widely replaced by PowerShell. The file extension for a VBScript file is .vbs.

JavaScript-   JavaScript is used widely for website and webpage design. It is the most popular programming language in the world. JavaScript provides many of the design and UI functions of the most popular websites, from Facebook and Amazon, to TikTok. The file extension for a JavaScript file is .js.



Automate tasks-	  The automation of repetitive or data intensive tasks is a core reason for scripting. Three examples of how a script can make a monotonous administrator task simple and time efficient are:
        -Importing a spreadsheet of user information into an Active Directory tree.
        -Renewing the IP leases of DHCP clients after a router update.
        -Restarting a collection of servers. The servers must be restarted in order and each one can restart only after the previous server has finished rebooting.
    A script can make a task simple, leaving the administrator to monitor the process, instead of manually performing it.

Remap network drives-	 Frequently, there are routers and switches between the client machines and the servers they connect to. If one of those routers were to fail, be reconfigured, or cause an interruption between client and server, a properly written script could remap necessary network drives.

Software installation-	 Although similar to automation, software installation is mentioned here separately because or its importance. When software standards change or new systems are brought online, a significant amount of time is consumed pushing the required software to a list of servers or desktops. A correctly configured script can automatically download and install software to prepare systems for use within an organization.

Automated backup-	 Good backups are a sign of a good administrator. Using a script to automate the process, dictating what data to back up and when makes it efficient as well. Automatically backing up a server before it is wiped and reinstalled or repurposed can save you time and headaches.

Gathering information-	  Sometimes administrators need information before they act. As an example, sometimes a specific piece of hardware (let's say a type of NIC) needs to be replaced because of a bug.
            With a good script, an administrator can run a query of all machines that might have the same hardware, compile a list of query results, and return the list when it finishes. That way, instead of connecting to each machine and looking manually, the task is done behind the scenes in much less time.

Updating systems-	Careful planning of which software updates to apply to what systems, as well as when to apply the updates, is always a good idea. Using scripting, administrators can send the updates to a specific list of systems, at a specific time, and restart those machines as needed.

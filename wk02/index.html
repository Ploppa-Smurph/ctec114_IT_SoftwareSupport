        <h2>2.1 Protection and Safety</h2>
            Capacitor -- stores electric charge
            ESD -- flow of electricity from one charged object to another
            Peripheral Device -- a device that connects to a computer, ie monitor, printer...
        <h3>2.1.1 Safety</h3>
                Remove jewelry. Make certain grounding pin is connnected. AC comes from wall -- converted to DC by PSU.

                Capacitor can store charge, even after unit is unplugged.
                FRU - Failed Replacable Unit
            Do NOT use a ESD wrist band around HIGH Voltage -- you will become the ground
                be aware of lasers, heat, cables and wires, work clean and be aware
        <h3>2.1.2 Safety Measures</h3>
            Power Handling Safety: be aware of the risks and powered components
            Capacitors: hold electrical charge and should be allowed to discharge
            ESD and High Voltage: 
            Peripherals: don't use a multimeter in a monitor
        <h3>2.1.3 Electrostatic Discharge</h3>

        <h3>2.1.4 ESD Protection</h3>
        <h3>2.1.5 ESD Facts</h3>
        ESD Safety Measures

        Implement the following measures to defend components from ESD:
        
                    -Keep the relative humidity in the room at an ideal range of 35-70%, and temperature between 72-77 degrees. The key is to avoid dry air in the computer repair location to prevent ESD.
                    -Use antistatic mats under the PC and on the floor.
                    -Discharge yourself before touching any computer component.
                    -When touching anything inside the computer, wear an antistatic wrist strap that is attached to the metal PC chassis with an alligator clip.
                    -Ground both yourself and the computer to the same ground. This provides a single path for the flow of electrical potential.
                    -Use static-resistant materials to handle computer components.
                    -Never touch the metal connectors on a circuit board.
                    -Keep the computer repair location free of materials that accumulate electric charges, such as plastic and Styrofoam.
                    -Store sensitive components in static shielding bags, which are usually grey. Static-resistant bags are not nearly as effective. They are usually tinted pink or blue.
                    -Unplug the system before working on internal components. Do not rely on the power cord for an electrical ground.
        <h2>2.2 Environmental Controls</h2>
            Line Conditioner - modifies the power signal to remove noise and create a smooth AC signal
            Standby Power Supply - offline device that goes online to provide power when undervoltage occurs
            Uninterruptible Power Supply - online device that is constantly providing battery power and being recharged by the wall outlet
        <h3>2.2.1 Environmental Concerns</h3>
            alkaline batteries can be thrown in trash (most states)
            L-ION cannot be thrown in trash
            LCD, CRT and Plasma are all considered Hazardous Waste 

            Ambient Room Temperature needs to be around 68 degrees. -- keep humidity between 40% - 60%
                use compressed air or non-static vaccuum         
        <h3>2.2.2 Environmental Facts</h3>
        <h3>2.2.3 Power Concerns</h3>
            manage the power that reaches your PC -- 
              Power Spike or Surge (spike last miliseconds instead of seconds). a power surge is a short increase
              Power Sag or Brown Out (sag lasts less time than brown out)
              Black Out.

              Surge Protector don't protect from brownouts and blackouts, only against surges
              UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) - Battery that you plug your computer and devices into

        <h3>2.2.4 Configure UPS Settings</h3>
            configure UPS' Management cable.
               plug in the UPS for 24 hours (12-24hrs)
               only some outlets are battery backed 
                 plug the UPS into the PC and run the software
        <h3>2.2.5 Power Concern Facts</h3>
        An uninterruptible power supply is an online device that is constantly providing battery power to the computer and being recharged by the wall outlet.
            There are two types of UPS systems:
                -An online UPS constantly powers the computer from the battery.
                -An offline UPS powers the computer from the wall power. When the power fails, a switch inside the UPS switches to power the computer from the battery. This is the most common form of UPS.
            UPS size is measured by the volt-amp (VA) rating. The capacity of the UPS determines the number of devices and how long the devices can run when power is interrupted.
            When purchasing a UPS, purchase one with enough battery power to power only critical devices such as the computer and a single monitor.
                -To reduce the amount of power required by the UPS, do not plug non-critical devices into the UPS.
                    -Laser printers require more power than most UPS systems are capable of providing. For this reason, you should not connect a laser printer to a UPS. If you must provide power to a laser printer, get a dedicated UPS for that device.
            A UPS is designed to provide enough power to shut a system down safely during an extended power outage. Most are not intended as long-term power solutions.
            The UPS connects to the power source (usually a wall socket), the computer plugs into the UPS, and the UPS is connected through a serial or USB port to the computer. Software on the computer uses this connection to monitor battery life and to detect when the regular power is lost. You can configure the software to shut the system down automatically when the battery charge reaches a certain level. You usually need to configure the following settings when working with UPS software:
                -Time to wait before sending a warning to clients.
                -Time to wait before beginning a shutdown.
                -Name of programs or commands to run during the shutdown.
            In addition to providing power when the power is lost, most UPS systems also condition the line and remove power spikes and sags.
            Most UPS devices sound an alarm when the AC power is lost. This alarm continues until AC power is restored, although many UPS devices have a switch to mute the alarm.
        <h2>2.3 Professionalism</h2>
        <h3>2.3.1 Professionalism</h3>
            Leave a good impression -- be on time and look professional (follow the dress code)
               address people by their title - respect privacy
               use proper language - avoid distractions

        <h3>2.6.2 PC and Networking Tools Facts</h3>
        Crimper-	A wire crimper, also known as a cable crimper, is used to secure connectors to the ends of network cables.
        Cable stripper-	A cable stripper is used to remove – or strip – the insulation from a wire. Crimpers and strippers can often be built into the same network tool.
        WiFi analyzer-	A WiFi analyzer can measure:
                        Signal strength
                        Network names
                        Network security settings
                        Network coverage
            This information is valuable for wireless network documentation, expansion, or troubleshooting.
        Toner probe-	A toner probe has two parts:
                    -Audio-frequency tone generator (sends a signal into the wire that is being tested).
                    -Inductive amplifier probe (provides an audible tone if any signal is detected on the wire being tested).
        Network tap-	A device used to collect data on traffic traveling across a network. The tap is usually installed right into your network cabling.
        Punch down tool-	A punch down tool is used to secure cable wiring to a punch-down block or a patch panel.
        3-pronged parts retriever-	A 3-pronged parts retriever is used to grasp and retrieve small parts that have fallen into difficult-to-reach areas.
        Multimeter-	A device that tests various electrical properties. For example, most multimeters can measure:
                AC and DC voltage
                Current (amps)
                Resistance (ohms)
                Capacitance
                Frequency
        Power supply tester- 	A custom multimeter used to test output from a PC power supply. The power supply tester has multiple connectors to test the output for each connector type.
        Cable tester-	A cable tester verifies that a network can carry a signal from one end to the other and that all wires within the connector are in the correct positions. Most testers have a single unit that tests both ends of the cable at once. Many testers come with a second unit that you can plug into one end of a long cable run to test the entire cable.
        Loopback plug-	A loopback plug is used to test network communications by redirecting a signal from the transmit port on a device to the receive port on the same device. Use the loopback plug to verify that a device can both send and receive signals.
        Combination ratchet/screwdriver-	A combination ratchet is a ratcheting handle with interchangeable bits that provides multiple features in a single tool.
            Bit ends can be replaced with Phillips and flat-head screwdrivers, hex sockets, and torx (star-shaped) bits.
            The ratcheting handle allows you to drive the screw without repositioning the driver.
                Most computer components use Phillips head screws.
        Antistatic pad/wrist strap- 	An antistatic pad provides an insulated covering to prevent static electricity from moving between objects and damaging computer components. When working with computer components, use a wrist strap connected to the antistatic pad and connect the pad to a ground.
        Known good spares-	Known good spares are a set of components that you know are in proper functioning order. If you suspect a problem in a component, swap it with the known good component. If the problem is not resolved, troubleshoot other components.
